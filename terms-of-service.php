                <h2>License and Template Usage</h2>
                <h3>Standard License</h3>
                <p>When you purchase a template from NeoWebX Template Store, we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the template subject to the following conditions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You may use the template to create a single end product for yourself or for one client (a "single application").</li>
                    <li>The end product may be used for personal or commercial purposes.</li>
                    <li>You may modify the template to suit your needs.</li>
                    <li>You may not redistribute, resell, lease, license, sub-license, or offer the template to any third party.</li>
                    <li>You may not use the template in a way that enables others to extract or reuse the template.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Extended License</h3>
                <p>The Extended License includes all the rights granted by the Standard License and additionally permits you to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use the template in a work which is created for redistribution or resale by you or your client.</li>
                    <li>Use the template in a commercial product which is sold to multiple users.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Extended License does not permit you to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Resell the template as a standalone product or include it in a template collection for resale.</li>
                    <li>Distribute the template in a manner that would allow a third party to extract and use the template separately from your end product.</li>
